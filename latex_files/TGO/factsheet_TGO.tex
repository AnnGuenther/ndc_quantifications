 \section{Emissions and socio-economic data}
 \label{sec:nonLULUCFSocioEco}
 With national emissions of 13.3~Mt CO$_2$eq, Togo contributed 0.02\% to global emissions in 2017, and in 2030 its share is estimated to stay at a similar level (Table~\ref{tab:overview}).
 The estimates for 2030 are based on the downscaled SSP2 Middle of the Road marker scenario (dmSSP2), in which Togo is estimated to emit 15.3~Mt CO$_2$eq in 2030.
 That change in emissions would constitute a substantial increase of 15.0\% compared to 2017. 
 The pathways dmSSP1--5 show a range of 15.3--22.7~Mt CO$_2$eq in 2030, and 19.9--67.1~Mt CO$_2$eq in 2050.
 The country's global rank in terms of total emissions per unit of GDP was 15 in 2017, and 176 regarding the per-capita emissions (20 and 180 in 2030).
 In terms of accumulated historical emissions, Togo contributed to the global 1850--2017 emissions by 0.01\%. 
 When only accounting for the years 1990--2017, its contribution increases to 0.02\%.
 All of the emissions are presented following GWP~AR4, and exclude emissions from LULUCF (exclLU), and bunkers fuels emissions (exclBunkers).

 For Togo, in 2017 the main emissions share on sectoral level (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsEmi}) came from the Agriculture sector (51.6\%), followed by Energy (39.9\%)
 The Kyoto~GHG with the highest emissions in 2017 was N$_2$O, constituting  43.1\% of the national emissions. 
 Second largest contributor was CO$_2$ (29.8\%)
 The total of F-gasesonly represented 0.0\%.
 The trend in total emissions is mostly driven by N$_2$O emissions from the Agriculture sector, which contributed 41.3\% to Togo's 2017 emissions.\footnote{Analysis based on the correlations between total national emissions (exclLU) versus the emissions of the combinations of main-sectors \& the gases CO$_2$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O and F-gases. 
 Only data from 2010 to 2017 are assessed. 
 The (up to) three gas \& sector combinations are chosen for which the slope of the regression line to the correlated values exceeds 0.2.}
 The total CO$_2$ emissions are expected to be 39.2\% of the national Kyoto~GHG emissions in 2030 (dmSSP2).

 \end{figure}

 The national GDP increased in recent years, and the emissions per unit of GDP had an opposite trend (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsSocioEco}).
 The population increased, and the per capita emissions dropped. 
 Following dmSSP2, the GDP is projected to increase towards 2050. 
 The emissions per GDP are estimated to decrease towars 2050. 
 Togo's population is assumed to grow towards 2050, and the per capita emissions are expected to increase towards 2050. 

 LULUCF emissions data for Togo are available from the following sources (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsLULUCF}): BUR (1$^{st}$)~/ 21, UNFCCC (2019)~/ 9, FAO (2019)~/ 28, with the number of available data points in 1990--2017 displayed additionally.
 Based on data from UNFCCC (2019), for the year 2017, LULUCF is estimated to be a net source of 17.4~Mt CO$_2$eq, which in absolute terms is higher than the non-LULUCF emissions of 13.3~Mt CO$_2$eq.
 The emissions range for UNFCCC (2019) and 1990--2017 is 10.8--18.5~Mt CO$_2$eq.

 \section{Data sources, additional information and references}
 \label{sec:dataSourcesRefs}

 \noindent \href{https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/pik/showshort.php?id=escidoc:4736895}{PRIMAP-hist v2.1}: emissions from PRIMAP-hist are data from the country reported data priority scenario (HISTCR).

 \noindent \href{https://zenodo.org/record/3638137#.X2syXouxU2w}{dmSSPs}: emissions, population and GDP data are PMSSPBIE data for the five marker scenarios.

 \begin{description}
 \item [SSPs] Shared Socio-economic Pathways. \newline
 Narratives and challenges to mitigation and adaptation: \newline
 \textit{SSP1}: Sustainability, Taking the Green Road (low~/ low); \newline
 \textit{SSP2}: Middle of the Road (medium~/ medium); \newline
 \textit{SSP3}: Regional Rivalry, A Rocky Road (high~/ high); \newline
 \textit{SSP4}: Inequality, A Road Divided (low~/ high); and \newline
 \textit{SSP5}: Fossil-fuelled Development, Taking the Highway (high~/ low).
 \item [GDP] Gross Domestic Product. \newline
 Throughout this document the GDP is given as GDP~PPP, with PPP being the Purchasing Power Parity.
 \item [GWP] Global Warming Potential. \newline
 We use GWP values from the IPCC 4$^{th}$ Assessment Report (AR4). 
 They reflect the forcing potential of one kilogram of a gas' emissions in comparison to one kilogram of CO$_2$ (GWP$_{CO2}$ = 1). 
 The GWPs correspond to a 100-yr period and are for CH$_4$:~25, for N$_2$O:~298, for SF$_6$:~22800, and for NF$_3$:~17200. 
 For the basket of HFC-gases the GWPs from AR4 are in the range 4--14800, and for PFCs 7190--12200. 
 To assess emissions of several GHGs, their emissions are weighted by their respective GWPs and presented in CO$_2$ equivalents (CO$_2$eq).
 \item [LULUCF] Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. \newline
 Emissions from LULUCF are excluded throughout the document, unless stated otherwise.
 \item [Bunkers fuels] Emissions from international aviation and shipping.
 \item [Kyoto~GHG] Kyoto~GHG (Greenhouse Gas) basket. \newline
 Carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF$_3$).
 \item [F-gases] Fluorinated gases. \newline
 Basket of HFCs, PFCs, and the gases SF$_6$ and NF$_3$. 
 Some F-gases have very long atmospheric lifetimes and high Global Warming Potentials.
 \item [Target reclassification] When a country has, e.g., an RBU target (relative reduction compared to Business-As-Usual), and the BAU emissions are provided, it can be quantified based on the given emissions, and is reclassified from type\_main~RBU to type\_reclass~ABS (absolute emissions target).
 Additionally, 'NGT' targets can be reclassified as 'ABU' (absolute reduction compared to Business-As-Usual) if absolute mitigation effects due to planned policies and measures are provided.
 \item [Quantification options] Different quantification options were tested. \newline
 \textit{dmSSP1--5}: down-scaled SSP marker scenarios; \newline
 \textit{type\_reclass}: external data prioritised (PRIMAP-hist, dmSSPs); \newline
 \textit{type\_main}: emissions data from within NDCs were prioritised; \newline
 \textit{100\% coverage \& estimated coverage}; \newline
 \textit{constant~emi}: constant emissions after last target year (instead of constant relative difference to baseline); \newline
 \textit{baseline uncondi}: baseline emissions as uncond. pathways for Parties without uncond. targets, even if baseline is better than cond. targets (instead of cond. pathway as uncond. pathways in these cases).
