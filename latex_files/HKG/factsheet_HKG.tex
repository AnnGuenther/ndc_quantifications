 \section{Non-LULUCF emissions and socio-economic data}
 \label{sec:nonLULUCFSocioEco}
 With national emissions of 52.6~Mt CO$_2$eq, Hong Kong contributed 0.1\% to global emissions in 2017, and in 2030 its share is estimated to stay at a similar level (Table~\ref{tab:overview}).
 The estimates for 2030 are based on the downscaled SSP2 Middle of the Road marker scenario (dmSSP2), in which Hong Kong is estimated to emit 55.9~Mt CO$_2$eq in 2030.
 That change in emissions would constitute an increase of 6.3\% compared to 2017. 
 The pathways dmSSP1--5 show a range of 44.3--62.9~Mt CO$_2$eq in 2030, and 45.3--91.7~Mt CO$_2$eq in 2050.
 The country's global rank in terms of total emissions per unit of GDP was 193 in 2017, and 69 regarding the per-capita emissions (196 and 77 in 2030).
 In terms of accumulated historical emissions, Hong Kong contributed to the global 1850--2017 emissions by 0.07\%. 
 When only accounting for the years 1990--2017, its contribution increases to 0.1\%.
 All of the emissions are presented following GWP~AR4, and exclude emissions from LULUCF (exclLU), and bunkers fuels emissions (exclBunkers).

 For Hong Kong, in 2017 the main emissions share on sectoral level (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsEmi}) came from the Energy sector (93.6\%), followed by Waste (3.8\%)
 The Kyoto~GHG with the highest emissions in 2017 was CO$_2$, constituting as much as 94.9\% of the national emissions. 
 Second largest contributor was CH$_4$ (4.1\%)
 The total of F-gasesonly represented 0.1\%.
 The total CO$_2$ emissions are expected to be 89.6\% of the national Kyoto~GHG emissions in 2030 (dmSSP2).

 The national GDP increased in recent years, and the emissions per unit of GDP had an opposite trend (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsSocioEco}).
 The population increased, and the per capita emissions dropped. 
 Following dmSSP2, the GDP is projected to increase towards 2050. 
 The emissions per GDP are estimated to decrease towars 2050. 
 Hong Kong's population is assumed to grow towards 2050, and the per capita emissions are expected to increase towards 2050.

 \section{LULUCF emissions}
 \label{sec:emiLULUCF}
 LULUCF emissions data for Hong Kong are available from the following sources (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsLULUCF}): FAO (2019).

 \textbf{High fluctuations? Data gaps? Difference between sources?}

 The pink timeseries was inter- and~/ or extrapolated (interpolation: linear, extrapolation: constant).}

 \section{Mitigation targets (NDC)}
 \label{sec:mitiTars}

 \textbf{ 
 Give the \%cov for the base and target year (and 2017).
 Global share for 2030 for the mitigated pathways and \% reduction relative to 1990 and 2017.
 Table with the 'input' data and the resulting targets (like ndcs\_targets.csv).}
 Hong Kong does not have an (I)NDC.
 Therefore the assumed 'mitigated' emissions pathways used for global aggregates equal the baseline emissions (dmSSP1--5).

 \label{sec:dataSourcesRefs}

 \noindent \href{https://dataservices.gfz-potsdam.de/pik/showshort.php?id=escidoc:4736895}{PRIMAP-hist v2.1}: emissions from PRIMAP-hist are data from the country reported data priority scenario (HISTCR).

 \noindent \href{https://zenodo.org/record/3638137#.X2syXouxU2w}{dmSSPs}: emissions, population and GDP data are PMSSPBIE data for the five marker scenarios.

 \begin{description}
 \item [SSPs] Shared Socio-economic Pathways.
 Narratives and challenges to mitigation and adaptation: 
 SSP1: Sustainability, Taking the Green Road (low~/ low);
 SSP2: Middle of the Road (medium~/ medium);
 SSP3: Regional Rivalry, A Rocky Road (high~/ high);
 SSP4: Inequality, A Road Divided (low~/ high); and
 SSP5: Fossil-fuelled Development, Taking the Highway (high~/ low).
 \item [GDP] Gross Domestic Product. 
 Throughout this document the GDP is given as GDP~PPP, with PPP being the Purchasing Power Parity.
 \item [GWP] Global Warming Potential. we use GWP values from the IPCC 4$^{th}$ Assessment Report (AR4). 
 They reflect the forcing potential of one kilogram of a gas' emissions in comparison to one kilogram of CO$_2$ (GWP$_{CO2}$ = 1). 
 The GWPs correspond to a 100-yr period and are for CH$_4$:~25, for N$_2$O:~298, for SF$_6$:~22800, and for NF$_3$:~17200. 
 For the basket of HFC-gases the GWPs from AR4 are in the range 4--14800, and for PFCs 7190--12200. 
 To assess emissions of several GHGs, their emissions are weighted by their respective GWPs and presented in CO$_2$ equivalents (CO$_2$eq).
 \item [LULUCF] Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 
 Emissions from LULUCF are excluded throughout the document, unless stated otherwise.
 \item [Bunkers fuels] Emissions from international aviation and shipping.
 \item [Kyoto~GHG] Kyoto~GHG (Greenhouse Gas) basket: carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF$_3$).
 \item [F-gases] Fluorinated gases.Basket of HFCs, PFCs, and the gases SF$_6$ and NF$_3$. 
 Some F-gases have very long atmospheric lifetimes and high Global Warming Potentials.
 \item [Target reclassification] When a country has, e.g., an RBU target (relative reduction compared to Business-As-Usual), and the BAU emissions are provided, it can be quantified based on the given emissions, and is reclassified from type\_main~RBU to type\_reclass~ABS (absolute emissions target).
 Additionally, 'NGT' targets can be reclassified as 'ABU' (absolute reduction compared to Business-As-Usual) if absolute mitigation effects due to planned policies and measures are provided.
