 \section{Non-LULUCF emissions and socio-economic data}
 \label{sec:nonLULUCFSocioEco}
 With national emissions of 0.7~Gt CO$_2$eq, Mexico contributed 1.6\% to global emissions in 2017, and in 2030 its share is estimated to stay at a similar level (Table~\ref{tab:overview}).
 The estimates for 2030 are based on the downscaled SSP2\footnote{\textbf{SSPs}: Shared Socio-economic Pathways.
 Narratives and challenges to mitigation and adaptation: 
 SSP1: Sustainability, Taking the Green Road (low~/ low);
 SSP2: Middle of the Road (medium~/ medium);
 SSP3: Regional Rivalry, A Rocky Road (high~/ high);
 SSP4: Inequality, A Road Divided (low~/ high); and
 SSP5: Fossio-fuelled Development, Taking the Highway (high~/ low).} Middle of the Road marker scenario (dmSSP2), in which Mexico is estimated to emit 0.9~Gt CO$_2$eq in 2030.
 That change in emissions would constitute a substantial increase of 17.6\% compared to 2017. 
 The pathways dmSSP1--5 show a range of 0.8--1.0~Gt CO$_2$eq in 2030, and 1.0--1.4~Gt CO$_2$eq in 2050.
 The country's global rank in terms of total emissions per unit of GDP\footnote{\textbf{GDP}: Gross Domestic Product. 
 Throughout this document the GDP is given as GDP~PPP, with PPP being the Purchasing Power Parity.} was 133 in 2017, and 89 regarding the per-capita emissions (133 and 89 in 2030).
 In terms of accumulated historical emissions, Mexico contributed to the global 1850--2017 emissions by 1.2\%. 
 When only accounting for the years 1990--2017, its contribution increases to 1.5\%.
 All of the emissions are presented following GWP~AR4\footnote{\textbf{Global Warming Potential (GWP)}: we use GWP values from the IPCC 4$^{th}$ Assessment Report (AR4). 
 They reflect the forcing potential of one kilogram of a gas' emissions in comparison to one kilogram of CO$_2$ (GWP$_{CO2}$ = 1). 
 The GWPs correspond to a 100-yr period and are for CH$_4$:~25, for N$_2$O:~298, for SF$_6$:~22800, and for NF$_3$:~17200. 
 For the basket of HFC-gases the GWPs from AR4 are in the range 4--14800, and for PFCs 7190--12200. 
 To assess emissions of several GHGs, their emissions are weighted by their respective GWPs and presented in CO$_2$ equivalents (CO$_2$eq).}, and exclude emissions from LULUCF\footnote{\textbf{LULUCF}: Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry. 
 Emissions from LULUCF are excluded throughout the document, unless stated otherwise.} (exclLU), and bunkers fuels\footnote{\textbf{Bunkers fuels}: emissions from international aviation and shipping.} emissions (exclBunkers).

 For Mexico, in 2017 the main emissions share on sectoral level (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsEmi}) came from the Energy sector (71.1\%), followed by Agriculture (13.9\%), and IPPU (7.8\%). 
 The Kyoto~GHG\footnote{\textbf{Kyoto~GHG} (Greenhouse Gas) basket: carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF$_6$), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF$_3$).} with the highest emissions in 2017 was CO$_2$, constituting as much as 72.7\% of the national emissions. 
 Second largest contributor was CH$_4$ (19.3\%), followed by N$_2$O (6.5\%). 
 The total of F-gases\footnote{\textbf{F-gases} (fluorinated gases): basket of HFCs, PFCs, and the gases SF$_6$ and NF$_3$. 
 Some F-gases have very long atmospheric lifetimes and high Global Warming Potentials.} only represented 1.6\%.
 The total CO$_2$ emissions are expected to be 72.4\% of the national Kyoto~GHG emissions in 2030 (dmSSP2).

 \end{figure}

 The national GDP increased in recent years, and the emissions per unit of GDP had an opposite trend (Fig.~\ref{fig:tsSocioEco}).
 The population increased, while the per capita emissions dropped. 
 Following dmSSP2, the GDP is projected to increase towards 2050. 
 The emissions per GDP are estimated to decrease towars 2050. 
 Mexico's population is assumed to grow towards 2050, and the per capita emissions are expected to increase towards 2050.

 Mexico has an NDC, with a GHG mitigation target of the type RBU (relative reduction compared to Business-As-Usual; main target type).
 The reclassified\footnote{\textbf{Reclassification}: when a country has, e.g., an RBU target (relative reduction compared to Business-As-Usual), and the BAU emissions are provided, it can be quantified based on the given emissions, and is reclassified from type\_main~RBU to type\_reclass~ABS (absolute emissions target).
 Additionally, 'NGT' targets can be reclassified as 'ABU' (absolute reduction compared to Business-As-Usual) if absolute mitigation effects due to planned policies and measures are provided.}  target type is ABS (absolute emissions target).
